           Possible UX improvement: consider implementing something like
           https://stackoverflow.com/a/77095425/3947332. Right now, the current UX always navigates
           & scrolls when the user clicks a quote.

           Arguably, a more optimal experience would be to perform the hash navigation on each click
           and :target UI handling, but DO NOT scroll to the given quote UNLESS it is actually out
           of the viewport (or is partially out). This'd give the user a less jerky experience when
           clicking around on any visible quotes. They'd have the agency to manually scroll around
           to find more quotes, or click ones that are partially out of the viewport to drag them
           back into view, but clicking on visible quotes would not jerk their view around.

           Unfortunately, this behavior cannot be achieved via pushState()/replaceState(), since
           those methods specifically do not affect :target; see
           https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/639.
        -->
        <!-- Note: the manual injection of the `pathname` before the hash is necessary to correct
        the relative link target, since the Document's `<base>` points to the site root `/` (to
        support the PR preview feature), but we want these relative links to target *this* page, as
        to be same-document navigations. -->
