        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>A list of quotes that matter to me, some of which accompany the material through which I
        became acquainted with the quote.</p>

        <!--
           Possible UX improvement: consider implementing something like
           https://stackoverflow.com/a/77095425/3947332. Right now, the current UX always navigates
           & scrolls when the user clicks a quote.

           Arguably, a more optimal experience would be to perform the hash navigation on each click
           and :target UI handling, but DO NOT scroll to the given quote UNLESS it is actually out
           of the viewport (or is partially out). This'd give the user a less jerky experience when
           clicking around on any visible quotes. They'd have the agency to manually scroll around
           to find more quotes, or click ones that are partially out of the viewport to drag them
           back into view, but clicking on visible quotes would not jerk their view around.

           Unfortunately, this behavior cannot be achieved via pushState()/replaceState(), since
           those methods specifically do not affect :target; see
           https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/639.
        -->
        <!-- Note: the manual injection of the `pathname` before the hash is necessary to correct
        the relative link target, since the Document's `<base>` points to the site root `/` (to
        support the PR preview feature), but we want these relative links to target *this* page, as
        to be same-document navigations. -->

Across the color line I move arm and arm with Balzac and Dumas, where smiling men and welcoming women glide in gilded halls.

Is this the life you grudge us, O knightly America? Is this the life you long to change into the dull red hideousness of Georgia? Are you so afraid lest peering from this high Pisgah, between Philistine and Amalekite, we sight the Promised Land?</p>

          <div onclick="location.href=location.pathname+'#insurgencies'" id="insurgencies" class=quote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these patterns in the history of many insurgent movements has been a disappointment in the direction that the movement has taken after victory, including claims that the revolution has been "betrayed" and that the later leaders and followers have failed to live up to the high standards set by their predecessors in the insurgency. None of this is surprising when such movements are examined in terms of their processes, including the incentives and constraints at work. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the kinds of people attracted to the original insurgency, under the initial set of incentives and constraints, tend to be very different from the kinds of people who gravitate to it after it has become successful and achieved a major part of its goals. By definition, an insurgent movement forms under a set of incentives and constraints very different from those which it seeks to create. Often the members face a certain amount of hostility, or even persecution, from those around them or from an elite currently benefitting from the status quo. These original insurgents may even face dangers to their careers or to their lives. These are not conditions which tend to attract timid careerists or mere opportunists, unless the opportunists foresee a high probability that the insurgency will succeed within period of time that is relevant to their personal ambitions. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the success of the insurgency, however, radically different incentives and constraints are created by that very success. Many Christians in the Roman Empire, for example, went from being a poor and persecuted minority to being among the powerful agents of a state religion, able to enrich themselves and to persecute others. A similar pattern marked the history of the Communists in Russia many centuries later. On a smaller scale, the life cycle of regulatory agencies in the United States has often been seen to follow a pattern leading to control by very different kinds of people and policies from those behind the movement which led to the creation of the agency in the first place.</p>
